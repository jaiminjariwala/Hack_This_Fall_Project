# Hack_This_Fall_Project
Hack_This_Fall Hackathon was Oraganized from 3rd Feb to 5th Feb, So worked on Local_Zomato_Idea.

#### **Local Zomato targets Local stalls on streets who sells great food. People have to stand in queue to order the food and have to wait; the idea would eliminate this through the webstie and the files uploaded by me are of Recommendation System, that suggests food to the user based on search and ratings by other users.**

#### **Have used Collaborative Based Filtering Recommendation System**

# Datasets: (I have Used Book Dataset and then Modified it to get the Users and Ratings Straight-away)
* At Kaggle -> Data: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jaiminmukeshjariwala/recommendation-system/edit
